## Architecture

This project follows the Clean Architecture principles to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. Here's a brief overview of the architecture layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic, use cases, and entities.
- **Data Layer**: Manages data sources, repositories, and data models.
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles the UI, state management (BLoC), and presentation logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Firebase Account: [Set up Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/FranklinBMW/tdd_clean_arch]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd flutter-clean-architecture-tdd
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Firebase Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project and add your Flutter app.
2. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app` directory.
3. Follow the [Firebase setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to complete the configuration.

```

- **data**: Contains data models, repositories, and data sources.
- **domain**: Contains entities, use cases, and repository interfaces.
- **presentation**: Contains BLoC, pages, and widgets for the UI.
- **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.
- **test**: Contains unit and widget tests.

## Running Tests
